**Note:** This gem is *abandoned* and has been superceded by [filmrolls-rs].

This is a utility designed to read the XML files used by the [Film Rolls iOS app][film-rolls], and enable batch EXIF tagging of scanned negatives in TIFF format based on the information in these XML files.

The gem is released under the [ISC license](LICENSE.md).
Eventually there will be some sort of [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) as well.
